## Introduction

This project implements a basic blockchain in Python. It allows you to:
- Create a **Genesis Block** (the first block in the chain)
- Add new blocks with data and a valid hash using a simple **Proof of Work** algorithm
- Validate the integrity of the entire blockchain

The goal is to help you understand how blockchains work by exploring the underlying mechanisms in a straightforward, easy-to-read codebase.

## Features

- **Block Creation:** Each block includes an index, timestamp, data, the previous block's hash, a nonce, and its own hash.
- **Hashing:** Uses SHA-256 to generate unique hashes for each block, ensuring data integrity.
- **Proof of Work:** Implements a simple mining algorithm that adjusts the block's nonce until a hash with a predefined number of leading zeros is found.
- **Blockchain Validation:** Includes functionality to check the consistency and security of the chain by verifying each block's hash and its connection to the previous block.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+** installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
